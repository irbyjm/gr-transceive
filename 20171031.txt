1830-2230 (4 hr)

* Shifted received RF from Ettus by -6 kHz to center FSK frequencies
  - verified good in Waterfall sink

### ISSUES ###
* Transmission is not good at higher rates
  - 01010101 at 96 kHz sampling does not look correct when sending in Waterfall (but looks good on receiver?)
  - 0000000010101011111111 does not look correct so play with sampling between transmitter and receiver
* Moving Average is not pulse-shaping the square wave (why?)
* Without pulse shaping Clock Recovery is not working
