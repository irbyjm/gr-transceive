* Captured File Sink off Rational Resamplers for 96 ksps dump to binary file; 265 Mb per file vs 275 Mb expected (~3% deviation)
* Restarted flowgraph solely using File Sources
  - tremendous amount of noise for most of the time
* Captured File Sink off Doppler-corrected Multipliers for 96 ksps dump to binary file; this should be far more accurate
  - cannot decode captured file without the proper shift values...
    - this is why file was sometimes good and usually bad.

  #### RESULTS ####
  * 11-15x increase in readable data after fix_decode.py
  * Flowgraph produces ~550 Mb per 6-minute run
    - Binary file produces reproducible results, however
      - In MUCH faster time...
