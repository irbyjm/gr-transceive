* Transmitted to Ettus MIMO using Bazooka Dipole from 5' and was able to decode a decent amount of transmissions
* Added polarizations together into Ettus MIMO using simple addition block for decode testing

#### RESULTS ####
* 6 minutes of reception

#### NOTES ####
* Add block seems to double signal strength vs single polarizations separate
* Polarizations summed without Delay modification do not stomp on received data
  - MIMO and Ethernet switch seem to be taking care of time offsets
