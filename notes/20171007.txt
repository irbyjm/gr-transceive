1350-1450 (1 hr)
1530-1600 (0.5 hr)

* Moved test dipole and test cross-dipole into CNL
* Ettus receiving on test cross-dipole
	- Delay is better compared to 2x Ettus antenna
	- Test cross-dipole is lambda/2 (4?) spaced

*** Testing ***
- Channel 0 Peak	332.53 us
- Channel 1 Peak	235.89 us
- Delta			96.94 us
- Samples/sec		2M sps
- Channel 0 Delay block		2M sps * 0 us		~= 0 samples
- Channel 1 Delay block		2M sps * 96.94 us	~= 193 samples

*** Suggestion ***
- Put delay fixing in another tab so the sliders are available but not taking up space from the main dash. That way they can be adjusted/configured and then switch back to relevant section.

### ISSUES ###
Forcing delay to one channel does not always seem effective between successive runs of GNU Radio flow graph (i.e., requiring a delay of 193 samples one run while needing 0 sample delay the next).

### HINT (pro-tip) ###
Set 'Auto' Trigger in QT GUI Time Sink

### NOTE ###
SDR PC: 192.168.10.1/24
N210 1 (ER20P0UP): 192.168.10.2
N210 2 (F3AC64)  : 192.168.10.3
Must disconnect from GMU network to communicate with Ettus
	Dual NIC would be preferable
