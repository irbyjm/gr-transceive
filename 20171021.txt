* Adjusted sampling rate and bandwidth of transmission flowgraph
  - Was able to get transmission speed to increase (perhaps patched)
  - GUI Waterfall Sink connected to output of Rational Resampler on transmitter shows a lot of noise and signal BER

*** TEST RESULTS ***
- Reception frequency is ~ 4 kHz above expected
- Initial success with Doppler correction
  - Sender and receiver Doppler shift needs to be synchronized (i.e., Gpredict) otherwise correction is only accurate for some of the samples
    - UDP sender/receiver?
      - This may not work over MASON-SECURE WiFi due to peer security

### TODO ###
- Salvage NIC from Pentium 4 chassis
