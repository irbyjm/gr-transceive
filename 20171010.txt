* Updated HackRF firmware from 2015.07.1 to 2017.02.1
* Received frequency is
  - 195002.8 kHz instead of 195000 kHz
  - 192012.5 kHz instead of 195020 kHz
  + aliasing?
* Added user 'sdrgroup' to 'usrp' group
  - changed /etc/security/limits.conf
    @usrp - rtprio  50 -> @usrp - rtprio  99
    (per USRP Hardware Driver and USRP Manual)
    - this removed error messages about scheduling
* Removed Throttle block to remove error message after fixing scheduling
* Calibrated the N210s (because the second one never was)
  - uhd_cal_rx_iq_balance (both dboards)
* Added Ubuntu Ettus repository
  - installed libuhd-dev
  - updated libuhd003, uhd-host
* Removed Ubuntu Ettus repository and removed GNU Radio, et al.
  - Because installing Ettus repo broke everything
    - Do not reinstall this

### TESTING ###
20171010 1707
  Low: 915005.8 kHz
  High: 915025.8 kHz
  Delta: 20 kHz
  - though there is faint aliasing below 915000 kHz
  - might need to mix with 5.8 kHz cosine to correct for this
    - test with Doppler shift first; compare with transmitter

*** RESULTS ***
- Waterfall is showing all frequencies +4 kHz
- Doppler shift is from 914994 kHz to 915034 kHz
- Channel 1 is showing stronger aliasing than Channel 0
